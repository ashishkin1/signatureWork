This project was attached because I believe it to be the absolute hardest project I have ever done in my time at the University of St. Thomas. The purpose of this group project was to create working code that uses the concept of Greedy Algorithms and Dynamic Programming. My partner wanted to work on the Greedy Algorithm section, leaving me with what was soon to be a project from hell. This project did teach me a lot about perseverence in coding however. I worked around 60+ hours on this assignment just to get the algorithm to work. I am very proud of this ugly mess of a code because of the sheer amount of hours I had put into it.


The way it runs is quite simple:
Download both the wordfile.tct and hw5interval.py and make sure they are both located in the same directory. From there, you uncomment the lines at the bottom and run the python file to get a result of the total number of words that are in the paramter you passed. In order to check for other "strings", you can call the function, passing your string and dictionary as parameters

EX: print(str(max_word_split('computerscienceisthebest', good_words))
