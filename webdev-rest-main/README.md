This project is a combination of two projects. The first was the creation of a RESTful API. This API essential allowed us to be connected to the SQLite Database that contained over half a million reported crimes that occured in St. Paul. We were assigned to make three requests (GET, PUT and DELETE). After that we used Vue.js to make a UI that was remotely user friendly. We used then used Leaflet to mark the locations of different neighborhoods in St Paul and show the total crimes commited in the most recent 1000 reported crimes. After that, we created an About page that goes over what we used and how to work the page.

In order to actually run the page, you first need to install node on your device. From there, you type node .\rest_server.mjs inside a powershell terminal linking to your rest server. Then in App.vue, you type npm run dev inside the console and press on the link the console gives you. Once you do that, you need to type localhost:8000 to connect to your API. Once you do that, you have the website running!
